So I decided I wanted to be professional and learn LaTeX. Both for my (now former) research position and for myself so I would have a resume that would stand up on its own and would be easy to edit and add things to depending upon what I do.

EDIT: As of 1/25/18 I have a more inclusive resume thats more recent but includes my address I'll still edit this version to reflect my current work envirornment but if you would like to see my real resume (and a CV I developed too) email me.
